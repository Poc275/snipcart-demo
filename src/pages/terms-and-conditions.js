                        <p>We process information about you in accordance with our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>. By using our site, you consent to such

                        <p>Conditions of Sale</p>
                        <p>("Conditions")</p>
                        <p>These Conditions apply where the Buyer wishes to order certain of the Company's Goods and the Buyer and the Company wish to regulate 
                            the sale and purchase of such Goods ("the order"). These Conditions have been brought to the attention of the Buyer.</p>

                        <p>1. INTERPRETATION AND DEFINITIONS</p>
                        <p>The "Buyer" means the person who purchases Goods from the Company; "Goods" means any goods agreed in the contract to be supplied to 
                            the Buyer by the Company (including any part or parts of them).</p>

                        <p>2. YOUR STATUS</p>
                        <p>2.1 By placing an order through our site, you warrant that:</p>
                        <p>(a) You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and</p>
                        <p>(b) You are at least 18 years old.</p>
                        <p>2.2 Any personal data that we gather concerning you shall be used only in accordance with our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

                        <p>3. APPLICATION OF TERMS</p>
                        <p>3.1 Subject to any variation under condition the supply of Goods will be on these Conditions to the exclusion of all other terms 
                            and conditions (including any terms or conditions which the Buyer purports to apply under any purchase order, confirmation of order, 
                            specification or other document) and no terms or conditions endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in the Buyer's purchase order, 
                            confirmation of order, specification or other document will form part of the Conditions. </p>
                        <p>3.2 These Conditions apply to all the Company's sales and any variation to these Conditions and any representations about the Goods 
                            shall have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing by the Company. The Buyer hereby acknowledges that no reliance has been placed 
                            on any such representations for which provision has not been made expressly in writing.</p>
                        <p>3.3 Each order for Goods by the Buyer from the Company shall be deemed to be an offer by the Buyer to purchase Goods subject to these 
                            Conditions and the Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to any such order he has notice of and such order is made on the basis of 
                            these Conditions.</p>
                        <p>3.4 No order placed by the Buyer shall be accepted or deemed to be accepted by the Company until a written acceptance of order is 
                            issued by the Company or (if earlier) the Company delivers the Goods to the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt an order confirmation 
                            or acknowledgement issued by the Company is not an acceptance of the Buyer's offer but merely confirmation of the contents of such 
                            offer and the Company reserves the right to decide whether to accept such offer in accordance with this clause.</p>
                        <p>3.5 The Buyer must ensure that the contents of its order are complete and accurate.</p>
                        <p>3.6 The Company reserves the right to treat each order accepted by the Company as a separate contract and the Company reserves the 
                            right to deliver the Goods by installments. Where Goods are delivered by installments the Company reserves the right to treat each 
                            installment as a separate contract.</p>

                        <p>4. DESCRIPTION</p>
                        <p>The "Marketing Materials" are issued or published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Goods described in 
                            them and such Marketing Materials do not and will not form part of the contract.</p>

                        <p>5. CONSUMER RIGHTS</p>
                        <p>Returns policy which is incorporated into the Conditions.</p>
                        <p>5.1 To cancel a contract, you must inform us in writing within the Cancellation Period. You must also return any related Good(s) to 
                            us immediately, in the same condition in which you received them, and at your own cost and risk. You have a legal obligation to 
                            take reasonable care of the Goods while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a 
                            right of action against you for compensation.</p>

                        <p>6. DELIVERY</p>
                        <p>Delivery is on the terms set out in our delivery policy and incorporated into these Conditions.</p>

                        <p>7. RISK/TITLE</p>
                        <p>7.1 The Goods will be at your risk from the time of delivery.</p>
                        <p>7.2 Ownership of the Goods will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Goods, including 
                            delivery charges.</p>

                        <p>8. PRICE</p>
                        <p>Unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing the price for the Goods shall be: (a) the price set out in the Company's price 
                            list published on the date of acceptance by the Company as defined herein; and (b) exclusive of any value added tax which is due for 
                            the Goods. Discount codes may be used from time to time, the minimum order value for which discounts can be applied is £20.00. Discounts 
                            can be withdrawn at anytime and their use remains at the discretion of James.</p>

                        <p>9. PAYMENT</p>
                        <p>9.1 Payment of the price for the Goods is due in full before delivery and failure to make payment on the due date shall without 
                            prejudice to the Company's other rights, entitle the Company to refuse delivery and/or cancel any contract between the Buyer and 
                            the Company. For the purposes of this condition only, the due date shall be the date of actual delivery or such date as the Company 
                            has communicated to the Buyer whether in writing or orally that it has the Goods in stock.</p>
                        <p>9.2 Time for payment shall be of the essence and no payment shall be deemed to have been received until the Company has received cleared funds.</p>
                        <p>9.3 All payments payable to the Company under the contract shall become due immediately upon termination of contract despite any other provision.</p>

                        <p>10. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY</p>
                        <p>10.1 The Company shall not be liable for any claim by the Buyer which is based on any defect in the quality or condition of the Goods 
                            or their failure to correspond with any specification expressly agreed in writing by the Company (whether or not delivery is refused by 
                            the Buyer) or any other dissatisfaction of the buyer except, and only to the extent set out in the returns policy which is incorporated 
                            into the Conditions.</p>

                        <p>THE FOREGOING INCLUDING THE RETURNS POLICY INCORPORATED INTO THESE CONDITIONS IS A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S WARRANTIES REGARDING 
                            THE GOODS AND SUBJECT TO CONDITION 11.2 IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, TERMS, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
                            (WHETHER UNDER STATUTE, AT COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE) INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES, TERMS, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF 
                            MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SUCH WARRANTIES PROVIDE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ANY DEFECT 
                            OR NON-CONFORMITY OF GOODS.</p>

                        <p>IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT 
                            LIMITATION, LOSS OF PRODUCTION, LOSS OF OR CORRUPTION TO DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS OR OF CONTRACTS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF OPERATION TIME, 
                            LOSS OF GOODWILL OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, WASTED MANAGEMENT OR STAFF TIME) ARISING OUT OF THE CONTRACT (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, 
                            TORT, NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FORM OF ACTION) OR ITS TERMINATION.</p>

                            the Sale of Goods Act 1979) are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the contract and nothing in these Conditions 
                            excludes or limits the liability of the Company for death or personal injury caused by the Company's negligence or fraudulent 
                            misrepresentation.</p>

                            (d) For any matter for which it would be illegal for the Company to exclude, or attempt to exclude, the Company's liability.</p>
                        <p>THE BUYER'S ATTENTION IS IN PARTICULAR DRAWN TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS</p>
                        <p>11.4 Subject to condition 11.2 the Company shall not be liable to the Buyer for any loss of profit, loss of business, loss of goodwill,

                        <p>11.6 The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the allocation of risk contained in this contract is reflected in the price agreed by the 
                            Company and the Buyer. </p>

                        <p>13. INDEMNITY</p>
                        <p>The Buyer shall indemnify the Company against all damage or injury to any person firm or Company against all proceedings charges and

                            that liability therefore has been expressly admitted in these Conditions.</p>

                        <p>GENERAL</p>

                            contract and the remainder of such provision shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                        <p>14.5 Failure or delay by the Company in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of any contract will not be construed as a waiver 
                            of any of its rights under the contract, and no waiver by the Company of any breach by the Buyer of these Conditions and no indulgence 
                            granted by the Company to the Buyer or otherwise shall affect the right of the Company in respect thereof or any subsequent breach and 
                            any waiver by the Company of any breach of any provision of the contract by the Buyer will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach 
                            and will in no way affect the other terms of the contract. </p>
                        <p>14.6 The Buyer shall not be entitled to assign the contract or any part of it without the prior written consent of the Company. The 
                            Company may assign the contract or any part of it to any person, firm or Company. The parties to any contract do not intend that any 
                            term of the contract will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person that is not a 
                            party to it. The formation, existence, construction, performance, validity and all aspects of the contract shall be governed by English 
                            law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>
