                        <p>Shankiel, Ilkeston Road,</p>
                        <p>Heanor, Derbyshire,</p>
                        <p>DE75 7DR,</p>

                        <h3>Our Returns Policy</h3>
                        <p>The following policies are to ensure that your shopping experience with James is fair and proper. The terms of these policies do 
                            not affect your statutory rights and are included in our full terms and conditions. If you have any questions, please email 
                            us at <a href="mailto:support@james-shop.co.uk">support@james-shop.co.uk</a>.</p>
                        <p>The rights of customers in the United Kingdom are covered under the Consumer Contract Regulations (2013). Customers outside of the 
                            United Kingdom are not covered under any legislation.</p>

                        <p>Items must be unworn and in new condition. Items must be returned with all product packaging in re-useable condition.</p>
                        <p>You have 14 days to request a return or exchange via our online returns form, and then an additional 14 days to return the items back to us.</p>
                        <p>Items can be returned for an exchange only once. Exchanged items cannot be returned for a refund.</p>
                        <p>The following items cannot be returned: gift vouchers, Swatches/Fabric Samples, socks, custom orders, custom items, colour matching service and 
                            personalised items</p>
                        <p>Outlet/Clearance products can be returned for Store Credit only.</p>
                        <p>If you would like to return your item(s) for an exchange, please contact Customer Services by email 
                            at <a href="mailto:support@james-shop.co.uk">support@james-shop.co.uk</a> with 
                            your order number and details of what you would like to exchange.</p>
                        <p>If you have missed the 14 day limit to request a refund, we might offer store credit in the form of a digital gift voucher. This 
                            offer will be made at our discretion and is not automatic for all orders outside of this date. We will only offer this to customers 
                            who can still return their items to us within the total 28 days. As this rule is not covered by any consumer laws or regulations but 
                            is simply our way of reaching a compromise, we maintain the right to remove or revoke this offer at any time. If you are over the 
                            28 days, I'm afraid it is too late and we will not accept your items back for reimbursement.</p>
                        <p>If you are returning goods from a country outside of the EU, you must clearly mark "RETURNING GOODS" on the parcel. Failure to do 
                            this could result in James receiving a customs charge, which will be deducted from your refund total. Your refund could also 
                            be delayed by up to 6 weeks if the parcel is held by the UK customs office.</p>
                        <p>If you are a customer outside of the European Union, your order may face customs charges/ import duty upon entry into your 
                            territory. Every country has a different threshold for importing goods, and it is your responsibility to understand these thresholds 
                            and costs before ordering.</p>
                        <p>Payment for these charges are your responsibility and James will not pay for any import charges. If you refuse to accept charges 
                            imposed on your order, and the courier charge us to get the items back, we will deduct the cost of this return postage from your 
                            refund value. In some cases, this may be the full amount of your original order.</p>
                        <p>If the courier attempts to deliver your order, but is unable to do so for any reason, they may hold your order at a local depot or 
                            collection point. It is your responsibility as the customer to collect your order or arrange a redelivery. If you fail to do so, 
                            and the order is sent back to us, you will not be refunded the original delivery cost, and the charge we have incurred to have 
                            it returned will be deducted from your refund. If you wish for us to send the order back to you, you will need to repay delivery 
                            costs for us to send the order back to you again.</p>
                        <p>Issuing a chargeback with your bank for anything other than fraud is a criminal offence.</p>
                        <p>The chargeback procedure is designed to help people who have fallen victim to fraudulent transactions, not as a means of getting 
                            your money back when a refund is denied or disputed, or an acceptable response to facing import duty. When a chargeback is issued 
                            against us, we will pass on the delivery address details to your local authority to be investigated.</p>
                        <p>James may appear on your bank statement as DGH Nexus Limited.</p>
                        <p> General wear and tear, damage or colour changes that occur with usage or improper storage will be your responsibility, not the fault 
                            of James. Please follow the care instructions provided with your items and if you have any questions, please contact us 
                            at <a href="mailto:support@james-shop.co.uk">support@james-shop.co.uk</a>.</p>
                        <p>Under the ‘Consumer Contracts Regulations’ (June 2014) customers are entitled to cancel their order (thereby requesting to return) within 
                            14 calendar days of receiving their goods. Refunds will not be issued before receiving the item(s), and can take up to 10 working days 
                            to be processed once received. We will refund the price of the goods in full. If you do not return the product packaging in a condition 
                            considered re-useable, or at all, we reserve the right to issue a £2.00 fee for each packaging (this does not refer to the external 
                            postage packaging), or to deny the refund entirely.</p>
                        <p>Customers are responsible for the cost of returning any item(s) to us, unless faulty or otherwise agreed by the company. It is your 
                            responsibility to ensure that reasonable care is taken and the goods and any packaging are sent back to us in the condition in which 
                            they were received. If not, you may not be entitled to your full refund.</p>
                        <p>All refunds must be returned with the same method of payment used, including specific credit or debit cards and accounts. We cannot, 
                            and will not, refund monies to an alternative method of payment.</p>
                        <p>James maintains the right to block or ban any customers who repeatedly return goods. This decision is not taken lightly and only 
                            occurs when customers are found to return goods excessively.</p>
                        <p>If your return does not meet our returns policy in any way, we have the right to deny your refund. If your refund is denied, it 
                            is your responsibility to get your items back and James will not pay to send the items back to you.</p>
